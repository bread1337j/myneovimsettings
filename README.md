# myneovimsettings
Made this so I can share it with my friends without having them follow a guide

This does not install neovim for you, just go to the repo download latest release extract it and make a bash alias towards it (what no sudo does to a man). 
This also does not install clangd, you need to install a zip and unzip it in ~/.config/nvim


just throw this thing into ~/.config/nvim (if you don't have that folder, make it) and run setup.sh. 

doesn't really have too many fancy plugins because I am making this to use on school computers

use ctrl + w to switch out of the file tree because I couldn't figure out how to make it work on startup
