# myneovimsettings
Made this so I can share it with my friends without having them follow a guide

just throw this thing into ~/.config/nvim (if you don't have that folder, make it) and run setup.sh. Obviously you need to have nvim installed. This does not install nvim for you.

doesn't really have too many fancy plugins because I am making this to use on school computers

use ctrl + w to switch out of the file tree because I couldn't figure out how to make it work on startup
